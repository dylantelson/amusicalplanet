# A Musical Planet

A Musical Planet is a fun website where you can test your musical knowledge and discover new genres from all over the world.

Choose any continent or difficulty, and A Musical Planet will choose from thousands of possible songs and play you a 30 second snippet. With each game consisting of 5 rounds, if you guess quickly and correctly on each, you can make the leaderboards!

-Custom maps, where a user can choose any number of countries and practice.
-Duel/battle royale modes where users can face others in real-time, with whoever guesses closest/fastest winning.
