# A Musical Planet

A Musical Planet was made with the goal of helping people discover traditional music from around the world in an interactive and fun way.

Choose any continent or difficulty, and A Musical Planet will choose from thousands of possible songs and play you a 30 second snippet. With each game consisting of 5 rounds, if you guess quickly and correctly on each, you can make the leaderboards!

## Technology
A Musical Planet is built with the MERN stack. This means the frontend is built with ReactJS, while the backend is coded in NodeJS, with Express for routing and MongoDB+Mongoose as the database.

## Roadmap
-A "Learn" section to the website, where users can learn about the music of any country.
-Country maps, such as the United States, divided by states/provinces.
-Custom maps, where a user can choose any number of countries and practice.
-Duel/battle royale modes where users can face others in real-time, with whoever guesses closest/fastest winning.
-Badges/achievements
